Unit 05 project for the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. This is an employee directory for a fictional company, ‘Awesome Startup’. This directory helps all the remote employees share contact information with each other.

For this fictional company, this code uses the Random User Generator API  (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees” and build an employee directory.



## Installation

There is nothing required to install for this project.


## Usage

This code requests a JSON object from the API and parses the data os that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the cmployee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.


## Extra Features

* Search feature - filter the directory by name. Needed to adjust the API request to retrieve a user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet.
* Modal toggle - can toggle between employees while the modal window is open.
* Structure, style and CSS were updated:
  * Updated font to Lexend to improve readability. Learn more: https://www.lexend.com/
  * Background image updated
